Description: standards compliant simple to use wiki
 DokuWiki is a wiki mainly aimed at creating documentation of any kind. It is
 targeted at developer teams, workgroups and small companies. It has a simple
 but powerful syntax which makes sure the datafiles remain readable outside the
 wiki and eases the creation of structured texts. All data is stored in plain
 text files -- no database is required.
